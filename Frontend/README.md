## **Frontend Coding Challenge**

### **General Guidelines:**

- We value quality over quantity (feature-completeness). It is totally fine if things are left out as long as you make a note of it so we can see the trade-off and why you make the

Decisions.

- The project should be hosted on Github or any source control repository for review.
- Commit history will help us to assess how you work during the challenge
- A README should be included. Treat it like a service that you are pushing to production.ins and outs of the service should be discussed

- Should focus on making the interfaces as polished as possible
- Make sure it runs on multiple browsers and platforms

### **Code Aspects:**

- **Architecture** : Code layout and architecture for the given frameworks and

libraries you use

- **Technology** Choices: What are some of the tradeoffs that you made to pick the

technologies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) you used?

- **Code Quality** : Is the code easy to read and maintainable? Consistent styling and

best practices for the languages used.

- **UX** : Is the interface easy and intuitive to use?
- **Testing** : Untested code is bad code. How are tests being set up? Is it easy to

change if the service requirements are changed?

- Utility function test
- Integration test
- Rendering test

- **Security** : What are some of the considerations that you&#39;ve had to make sure the

service is secure? Any obvious vulnerabilities?

### **Project** :
