## **Frontend Coding Challenge**

### **General Guidelines:**

- We value quality over quantity (feature-completeness). It is totally fine if things are left out as long as you make a note of it so we can see the trade-off and why you make the Decisions.

- The project should be hosted on Github or any source control repository for review.
- Commit history will help us to assess how you work during the challenge
- A README should be included. Treat it like a service that you are pushing to production.ins and outs of the service should be discussed

- Should focus on making the interfaces as polished as possible
- Make sure it runs on multiple browsers and platforms

### **Code Aspects:**

- **Architecture**: Code layout and architecture for the given frameworks and libraries you use
- **Technology**: What are some of the tradeoffs that you made to pick the technologies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) you used?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code easy to read and maintainable? Consistent styling andbest practices for the languages used.
- **UX**: Is the interface easy and intuitive to use?
- **Testing**: Untested code is bad code. How are tests being set up? Is it easy to change if the service requirements are changed?
- **Security**: What are some of the considerations that you've had to make sure the service is secure? Any obvious vulnerabilities?

### **Project** :

  - The user's trip planner should be persisted
  - A map should be used to display the locations
  - Implement one test case for each type below
     - Utility function test
     - Integration test
     - Rendering test
