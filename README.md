Hey there, thanks for taking the time out of your day to tackle this problems set with us! In this
exercise we are mainly looking for the following elements:

* correctness
* coherent code structure
* readability
* test coverage

In other words, the end product should be something that you wouldn't hesitate to hit shippit on and
productionize! Feel free to tackle the question with your programming language of choice.
We expect each candidate to spend no more than 2 hours on the solution (we'll take your
word for it ðŸ˜‡). As there are multiple parts to the question, do not feel the need to complete all
of the parts, instead please feel free to stop once you've crossed the two hour mark. If you were in
the midst of a question, feel free to leave some pseudocode for how you would've completed it.

You'll find the dataset for the questions in `data.csv`. The dataset represents temperatures reported
by specific weather stations (`station_id`) at a particular point in time (`date`).
For simplicity the `date` values are simply numeric values between `1` and `8`, and represents distinct
points in time. I.e the *time* of a temperature reported on `date = 1` by `station_id = 1` is equivalent
to that of a temperature reported on `date = 1` by `station_id = 2` (and so on).

**Part 1**:

Create a function that when called returns the `station_id`, and `date` pair that reported the
lowest temperature. If a tie occurs simply return one pair at random.

**Part 2**:

Create a function that returns the `station_id` that experienced the most amount of temperature
fluctuation across the 8 dates that it reported temperatures for. For example with the following dataset:

    station_id, date, temperature_c
             1,    1,             5
             1,    2,             0
             1,    3,             5

we are expecting the total fluctuation to be 10 degrees, as opposed to 0 which is the net difference
in temperature between the first and last dates.

**Part 3**:

Create a function that will return the `station_id` that experienced the most amount of temperature
fluctuation for any given range of dates.
